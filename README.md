# 🌱 EcoTrack

**EcoTrack** is an AI-powered mobile app that gamifies waste sorting to promote environmental awareness and reduce carbon emissions. By using object recognition, users can scan waste items, identify the correct disposal category, and earn points that contribute to real-world tree planting.

---

## 🎯 Inspiration

We were inspired by the need to **reduce carbon emissions** while making **garbage sorting more engaging and educational**. Our goal was to create a platform that encourages users to recycle properly by rewarding them through an interactive experience.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Users **scan a waste item** using their phone camera.
- The app categorizes the item into one of four types:
  - Organic
  - Paper
  - Containers
  - Garbage
- The user then selects what they believe is the correct category.
- If correct, they **earn in-game points**.
- Accumulated points contribute toward planting **real trees** globally.

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Frontend**: Designed a clean, eco-friendly interface using **Figma**, optimized for intuitive navigation and gamification.
- **Backend**: Built an **object recognition AI** using:
  - Python
  - PyTorch
  - EfficientNet
  - OpenCV
  - ImageNet
- The AI model classifies scanned items into the 4 recycling categories based on image recognition.

---

## ⚔️ Challenges We Faced

- Training the model through **10 epochs** was too time-consuming during the limited time of the hackathon.
- We had to work with **partially trained data**, which impacted prediction accuracy for some untrained items.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments

- Successfully set up a working **AI demo** that could categorize common waste items.
- Designed a **polished frontend prototype** showing the user experience and app flow.
- Built a strong foundation for a scalable and impactful app.

---

## 📚 What We Learned

- How to structure and train a machine learning model using epochs, and the importance of **training loss** and **validation loss** in AI development.
- Best practices in **team collaboration** between frontend and backend developers during time-constrained sprints.

---

## 🌍 What’s Next for EcoTrack

- **Improve AI model accuracy** through more comprehensive training and dataset expansion.
- **Enhance frontend UI/UX** with additional gamified features and user customization.
- Integrate a **real-world reward system** for planting trees through partner organizations.
